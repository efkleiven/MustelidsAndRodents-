# MustelidsAndRodents
In this repository you will find code and data to run a dynamic occupancy model for rodents and mustelids with two spatial scales. In addition to explisitly accounting for the interaction betweem rodents and mustelids we will also estimate the colonization of the two as a function of environmental factors (e.g. habitat and snow conditions).
